üìå Featured Projects

ÔÇ∑ BACKORDER PREDICTION FOR SUPPLY CHAIN OPTIMIZATION 
	Platform used: Python, Machine Learning, Pandas, NumPy, Streamlit, GitHub, Docker, Azure, SQL. 
Description:  Developed a Random Forest Classifier to predict potential backorders, enhancing inventory management. 
Managed data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to ensure precise predictions.  Stored data 
connections in SQL for efficient data management and integration. Deployed the model with a CI/CD pipeline on Cloud, 
ensuring streamlined updates and maintenance. Utilized container, ensuring scalable and reliable deployment. 

ÔÇ∑ TEXT SUMMARIZATION USING NLP 
	Platform used: Python, Pandas, NLTK, Cloud  
Description: The project aims to build a text summarization tool that can automatically generate summaries for 
documents, articles, or other textual content. The system can be tailored for specific use cases, such as summarizing 
news articles, research papers, legal documents, or customer reviews. The project can implement either extractive or 
abstractive summarization techniques, or a combination of both. 

ÔÇ∑ ONLINE FOOD ORDERING WEB APPLICATION  
Platform used: Python, SQL, Streamlit, Pandas  
Description: Objective of our project is to provide a convenient and efficient way for customers to order and receive 
food online from their location. The main focus from this project is to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for 
customers, from the moment they start browsing the menu to the moment they receive the food. The technologies we 
have used are Python, MySQL and some python libraries like Pandas, Streamlit etc. 

ÔÇ∑ MINI PROJECT ‚Äì WEATHER APP
